# workflow.ai

Hackathon project for a web dashboard orchestrating Jira + GitHub AI workflows.

## Apps

- `dashboard/` – Next.js App Router dashboard with Tailwind styling. It
  prototypes the idea capture flow, MCP conversation builder, and integration
  hand-offs to Jira + GitHub Copilot.

## Getting started

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

> If the default npm CLI fails in your environment, you can use `pnpm` or `yarn`
> instead; the project does not depend on a specific package manager.

For a one-command launch that auto-opens your browser:

```bash
npm run dev:open
```
